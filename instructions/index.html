<h1>Installation instructions, with photos</h1>

<h2>1. Upload Plugin to WordPress</h2>

	<p>Copy the entire wpbook directory into your wordpress plugins folder,
   <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code></p>

   <p>You should have a directory structure like this (of course you'll likely have 
   different plugins installed):
   </p>

</p>

<h2>2. Create Facebook App</h2>

<p>Set up a New Application at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/developers/">http://www.facebook.com/developers/</a>, obtaining
   a secret and API key.  </p>

   <p><img src="key.png" border="1" /></p>
	
   <p>Set the callback url to your blog url, including  a trailing slash. (Example: http://www.yourblogurl.com/)</p>
   
   <p><img src="callback.png" border="1"/></p>
   
   <p>For canvas url, you just need something <em>all lower case</em>, unique, with no spaces, and no trailing slash. Remember it.</p> 
   <p>Set the application to use an iFrame, not fbml, 
   and to "resizable" NOT "smart size." (Using iFrames lets you use javascript, objects, and other 
   tags  not allowed in FBML inside blog posts, setting to resizable enables Facebook javascript to resize
   the iframe to the content).</p>
   <p><img src="canvas.png" border="1" /></p>
   
<h2>3. Activate the Plugin</h2> 

<p>Login to Wordpress Admin and activate the plugin</p>

<h2>4. Fill out Plugin Settings</h2>

<p>Using the WPBook menu, (Dashboard->Settings->WPBook) fill in the appropriate information including Facebook application secret 
   and API keys, as well as your application canvas url. </p>

   <p><img src="wpbook.png" border="1" /></p>

   <p>Enabling the "Show Invite Friends Link" will show a link inside 
   Facebook when viewing your application which allows users to send
   invites to their friends. </p>

	<p><img src="links.png" border="1" /></p>

   <p>Comments inside Facebook can be enabled or disabled without any impact
   on comments when your blog is viewed outside Facebook. If you have comments
   enabled, you can optionally require users to provide their email address. 
   (Facebook does not allow access to the user's email address, so you can 
   really only ask users to provide one, not prefill it automatically). </p>

   <p>The "Give WPBook credit" option adds a line at the bottom of your Facebook
   application pages which says "This Facebook application powered by the 
   WPBook plugin for Wordpress" - I'd love it if you would leave this enabled
   but it is not required.  </p>

   <p>The "Share this post" links can also be enabled or disabled. If they are
   enabled, they will allow the user to "share" your blog posts using the 
   built in Facebook Share mechanism, including sending a message to friends
   or posting in their profile. </p>

   <p><img src="links.png" border="1" /></p>

  <p> The "Enable 'view post at external site' link" enables a link to each blog post 
   at your full blog url (outside Facebook). This is useful to get folks going
   to your blog outside Facebook, to see it full size/theme etc.</p> 

   <p>The "Link position for share button and external link button" option determines
   where, within each post, those two links will appear - either at the top of the 
   post (before the post content) or at the bottom of the post (after the post
   content). </p>

   <p>"Enable Facebook users to add your app to their profile" will show an "Add to 
   Profile" button for users viewing the app inside Facebook - this lets them choose
   to add the application to their profile. </p>
   
   <p><img src="links.png" border="1"  /></p>
   <p>Here's what the user should see when they click that "add to profile" link:</p>
   <p><img src="profile.png" border="1" /></p>
   <p>And here's what the added profile section will look like:</p>
	<p><img src="in_profile.png" border="1"  /></p>
	<p>Note that the "add to profile" link is not shown to users who have already added 
	the app to their profiles</p>

<h2>5. Add Application to Pages</h2>

<p>Follow these directions to add your application to Facebook pages, not user profiles. This is
a bit complicated, but isn't the kind of thing you should have to do often.</p> 

   <p>You'll need to enable "Pages" and "User Profiles" in the "Authorization" 
   tab of the Facebook settings.</p>
   
   <p><img src="pages.png" border="1"  /></p>

   <p>To add to a Facebook page:</p>
   
      <p>A. Go to your Facebook application's "About" page. (Easiest way is to go to 
         the application itself, and click on the application name at the bottom 
         where it says "Page built by"). <p>
         
         <p><img src="built.png" border="1" /></p>
         
      <p>B. Click on "Add to Page" in the right column. (If that doesn't appear, you
         haven't enabled "Pages" in the Facebook Settings for your application - 
         authorization tab - or you don't own any pages.)</p>
         
         <p><img src="add_to_page.png" border="1" /></p>
         
         <p>Facebook will ask you to confirm that you are adding the app to a page</p>
         
         <p><img src="page_confirm.png" border="1"  /></p>
         
      <p>C. Go back to the page to which you added the app, and click on "edit page."<p>
      <p><img src="edit_page.png" border="1" /></p>
      <p>D. While looking at the page in edit view, find your application in the list 
         of applications on that page. Click on the little pencil in the upper
         right hand corner of the box for your application, and choose edit</p>
         <p><img src="edit.png" border="1"  /></p>
      <p>E. You should be taken to a page which thanks you for adding the app.</p>
